# Simple Path Tracer GL

A simple path tracer using compute shader and OpenGL 4.5. It is a simplified version of [my CPU path tracer](https://github.com/PepcyCh/simple-path-tracer) now, but I want to make it a better GPU path tracer by adding something like denoising and so on.

## Implemented Features

* Microfacet material
  * `metalic` is not implemented
  * there are bugs about `is_translucent`
